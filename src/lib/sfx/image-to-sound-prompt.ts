CARD GENERATION RULES
- Generate 3 to 8 soundCards depending on the image complexity.
- For atmospheres, create loopable beds (30s) and non-looping micro-events (4s).
- For Foley, focus on specific material interactions.
- Ensure 'prompt' is highly descriptive of the SOUND, not just the image.

Analyze the image and return the JSON. Do not include markdown code blocks, just the raw JSON object.`;
