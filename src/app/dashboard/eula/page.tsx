      "Phonostack is an open-source, local-first sound research and design tool. The app stores project metadata, indexed sounds, generated or derived sounds, provider settings, analysis caches, and exports on the user's machine.",

    title: "2. Your sounds and folders",
    body: [
      "Local library folders remain your material. Phonostack should index file paths, metadata, descriptors, and tags without taking ownership of the original audio.",

    title: "3. Generated, derived and organized audio",
    body: [
      "Generated sounds should be saved locally with prompt text, provider, model, settings, source references, and synthetic-origin metadata where possible.",

      "Phonostack should not ship with shared ElevenLabs, Gemini, LLM, agent, webhook, or storage credentials. Each user configures their own providers locally and uses their own provider accounts.",

    title: "5. Responsible use",
    body: [
      "Do not use Phonostack to impersonate real people, hide synthetic origin where disclosure is expected, infringe third-party rights, or misrepresent generated audio as documentary evidence.",
      "You are responsible for the rights and permissions attached to any local sounds, reference material, prompts, generated outputs, and exports you use.",

    title: "6. Research exports",
    body: [
      "Dataset and benchmark exports should identify whether each sound is local, generated, or derived. They should also include tags, prompts, descriptors, comparison notes, and source provenance when available.",
      "Exports are meant to be inspectable and portable, not a hidden lock-in format.",
